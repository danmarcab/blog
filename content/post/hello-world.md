Hi there! My name is Daniel Marin Cabillas, welcome!

I am starting this blog to improve my writing skills and hopefully
learn one thing or two on the way. I'll try to have English and Spanish
versions of most of the articles.

Given I am a Software Engineer I will mostly write about programming in general,
web development and computer science.

I hope someone can learn something reading this (even if is how not to write a blog ðŸ˜€).
